    <h1>Complaint Handling & Resolution Process</h1>

    <p>
        This document explains how complaints are handled on the platform so that users clearly understand
        what happens after submitting a complaint.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Purpose of the Complaint System</h2>
    <p>
        The complaint system exists to protect users from fraud, misrepresentation, or unfair practices,
        while also ensuring fairness to sellers. Every complaint is reviewed carefully by our team based
        on available evidence.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How Payments Work</h2>
    <p>
        All payments on the platform are made <strong>directly to the seller’s payment account</strong>.
        The platform does <strong>not</strong> hold user funds at any stage of the transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of this structure:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The platform does not automatically control or store payment amounts.</li>
        <li>Refunds are <strong>not guaranteed in every case</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        However, in certain situations, the platform may still be able to initiate a refund
        <strong>before the payment is settled into the seller’s bank account</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. What Happens After You Submit a Complaint</h2>
    <p>When a complaint is submitted, the following steps take place:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> Your complaint is recorded and acknowledged.</li>
        <li><strong>Initial Review:</strong> Complaint details and provided evidence are reviewed.</li>
        <li><strong>Investigation:</strong> Seller communication, transaction status, and account history are checked.</li>
        <li><strong>Decision:</strong> A final outcome is determined based on findings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Possible Outcomes</h2>
    <p>After review, <strong>only one of the following outcomes is possible</strong>:</p>

    <h3>A. Refund (If Technically Possible)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If the payment has <strong>not yet been settled</strong> to the seller’s bank account, a refund may be initiated.</li>
        <li>Refunds depend on technical feasibility and timing.</li>
        <li>If settlement is completed, a refund may no longer be possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
        Submitting a complaint does not automatically guarantee a refund.
    </div>

    <h3>B. Seller Account Action</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If fraud, scam activity, or serious violations are identified, the seller’s account may be permanently banned.</li>
        <li>This action is taken to protect users and maintain platform safety.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Even if a refund is not possible, strict action will still be taken against fraudulent sellers.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Important Things to Understand</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Complaints are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</li>
        <li>Refunds depend on transaction status and timing.</li>
        <li>Payments already settled into a seller’s bank account cannot be reversed.</li>
        <li>False or misleading complaints may result in action against the reporting account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>To help us resolve complaints effectively, users should:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Submit accurate and complete information</li>
        <li>Provide valid proof when available</li>
        <li>Avoid submitting false or malicious complaints</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Transparency Commitment</h2>
    <p>
        We are committed to handling complaints fairly, transparently, and responsibly.
        While financial reversals may not always be possible, protecting users and maintaining
        platform trust is our highest priority.
